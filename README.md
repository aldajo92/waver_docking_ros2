# WAVER Docking (WIP)

This is a ROS2 package made in C++ as a proof of concept to implement a modified version of the PID Controller to perform a docking operation based on localization.

# Execution
```bash
ros2 run waver_docking docking_node --ros-args --params-file ./src/waver_docking/params/pid_params.yaml
```
